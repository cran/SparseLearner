Title: Sparse Learning Algorithms Using a LASSO-Type Penalty for
        Coefficient Estimation and Model Prediction
Version: 1.0.1
Author: Pi Guo, Yuantao Hao
Maintainer: Pi Guo <guopi.01@163.com>
Description: Coefficient estimation and model prediction based on 
  the LASSO sparse learning algorithm and its improved versions 
  such as Bolasso, bootstrap ranking LASSO, two-stage hybrid LASSO 
  and others. These estimation procedures are applied in the fields 
  of variable selection, graphical modeling and forecasting.
