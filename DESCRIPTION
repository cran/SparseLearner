Title: Sparse Learning Algorithms Using a LASSO-Type Penalty for
        Coefficient Estimation and Model Prediction
Version: 1.0-2
Author: Pi Guo, Yuantao Hao
Maintainer: Pi Guo <guopi.01@163.com>
Description: Coefficient estimation and model prediction based on the LASSO sparse 
  learning algorithm and its improved versions such as Bolasso, bootstrap ranking 
  LASSO, two-stage hybrid LASSO and others. These LASSO estimation procedures are 
  applied in the fields of variable selection, graphical modeling and ensemble 
  learning. The bagging LASSO model uses a Monte Carlo cross-entropy algorithm to 
  determine the best base-level models and improve predictive performance.
