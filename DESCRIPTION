Title: Sparse Learning Algorithms Using a LASSO-Type Penalty for
        Coefficient Estimation and Model Prediction
Version: 1.0
Author: Pi Guo, Yuantao Hao
Maintainer: Pi Guo <guopi.01@163.com>
Description: Performs the LASSO-type sparse learning algorithm and its improved versions such as Bolasso, bootstrap 
  ranking LASSO, two-stage hybrid LASSO and so on for coefficient estimation and model prediction. These estimation 
  procedures are applied in the fields of variable selection, graphical modeling and model prediction.
